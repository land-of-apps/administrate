# v0.36.0
* *appmap.yml* package definition may specify `gem`.
* Skip loading the railtie if `APPMAP_INITIALIZE` environment variable
  is set to `false`.

# v0.35.2
* Make sure `MethodEvent#display_string` works when the value's `#to_s` and/or `#inspect`
  methods have problems.
  
# v0.35.1
* Take out hooking of `IO` and `Logger` methods.
* Enable logging if either `APPMAP_DEBUG` or `DEBUG` is `true`.

# v0.35.0
* Provide a custom display string for files and HTTP requests.
* Report `mime_type` on HTTP response.

# v0.34.6
* Only warn once about problems determining database version for an ActiveRecord
  connection.

# v0.34.5
* Ensure that hooking a method doesn't change its arity.

# v0.34.4
* Make sure `AppMap:Rails::SQLExaminer::ActiveRecordExaminer.server_version` only calls
  `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.database_version` if it's available.
* Fix `AppMap:Rails::SQLExaminer::ActiveRecordExaminer.database_type` returns `:postgres`
  in all supported versions of Rails.

# v0.34.3
* Fix a crash in `singleton_method_owner_name` that occurred if `__attached__.class` returned
  something other than a `Module` or a `Class`.
  
# v0.34.2
* Add an extension that gets the name of the owner of a singleton method without calling
  any methods that may have been redefined (e.g. `#to_s` or `.name`).
  
# v0.34.1
* Ensure that capturing events doesn't change the behavior of a hooked method that uses
  `Time.now`. For example, if a test expects that `Time.now` will be called a certain
  number of times by a hooked method, that expectation will now be met.
* Make sure `appmap/cucumber` requires `appmap`.

# v0.34.0

* Records builtin security and I/O methods from `OpenSSL`, `Net`, and `IO`.

* Update README with information about recording Cucumber tests.
* **AppMap.initialize** automatically runs when `AppMap` is required, unless disabled
  by environment variable `APPMAP_INITIALIZE=false`.
* **AppMap.hook** no longer takes a `configuration` argument.
* Add **AppMap::Util.scenario_filename**.

# v0.27.0

# v0.26.1

* Fix a bug that caused duplicate entries in the list of frameworks that appear
  in the `metadata` section of an appmap.
  
# v0.26.0

* **appmap upload** is removed. Upload functionality has been moved to
  the [AppLand CLI](https://github.com/applandinc/appland-cli).

all queries.

* Fixes an issue which prevented a remote recording from returning scenario data successfully.
* Remote recording routes now return descriptive status codes as intended.
* Remote recording routes now have the correct `Content-Type` header.

# v0.24.0

Internals of `appmap-ruby` have been changed to record each method event using `alias_method`,
rather than `TracePoint`. Performance is much better as a result.

**WARNING** Breaking changes

* **Rack** apps no longer generate `http_server_request` events.
* **appmap inspect** has been removed. `appmap-ruby` no longer parses the source tree. Instead, it observes the methods as they are loaded by the VM. So, to get a class map, you have to create a recording. The `RSpec` recorder still prints an inventory to `Inventory.appmap.json` when it exits. The class map in this file contains every class and method which was loaded by any of the tests.

# v0.23.0

* **appmap stats** command added.

# v0.22.0

* **RSpec** recorder generates an "inventory" (AppMap with classMap, without events) named `Inventory.appmap.json`.
* **appmap inspect** generates an inventory AppMap which includes `version`, `metadata`, and `classMap`. Previously, the file output by this command was the class map represented as an array.

# v0.21.0

* Scenario data includes `recorder` and `client` info, describing how the data was recorded.

# v0.20.0

Updated to [AppMap file format](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap) version 1.2.

* **Event `message`** is now an array of parameter objects.
* The value of each `appmap:` tags in an RSpec is recorded as a `label` in the AppMap file metadata.
* `layout` is removed from AppMap file metadata.

# v0.19.0

* **RSpec** feature and feature group names can be inferred from example group and example names.
* Stop using `ActiveSupport::Inflector.transliterate`, since it can cause exceptions.
* Handle StandardError which occurs while calling `#inspect` of an object.

# v0.18.1

* Now tested with Rails 4, 5, and 6.
* Now tested with Ruby 2.5 and 2.6.
* `explain_sql` is no longer collected.
* `appmap/railtie` is automatically required when running in a Rails environment.

# v0.17.0

**WARNING** Breaking changes

* **appmap upload** expects arguments `user` and `org`.
* **appmap upload** receives and retransmits the scenario batch id
* assigned by the server.

# v0.16.0

**WARNING** Breaking changes

* **Record button** removed. Frontend interactions are now recorded with a browser extension.
  As a result, `AppMap::Middleware::RecordButton` has been renamed to 
  `AppMap::Middleware::RemoteRecording`

# v0.15.1

* **Record button** moved to the bottom of the window.

# v0.15.0

**WARNING** Breaking changes

* **AppMap version** updated to 1.1
* **Event `parameters`** are reported as an array rather than a map, so that parameter order is preserved.
* **Event `receiver`** reports the `receiver/this/self` parameter of each method call.

# v0.14.1

* **RSpec recorder** won't try to modify a frozen string.

# v0.14.0

* **SQL queries** are reported for SQLite.

# v0.13.0

* **SQL queries** are reported for ActiveRecord.

# v0.12.0

* **Record button** integrates into any HTML UI and provides a button to record and upload AppMaps.

# v0.11.0

* Information about `language` and `frameworks` is provided in the AppMap `metadata`.

# v0.10.0

* **`AppMap::Algorithm::PruneClassMap`** prunes a class map so that only functions, classes and packages which are
  referenced by some event are retained.

# v0.9.0

* **`appmap/rspec`** only records trace events which happen during an example block. `before` and `after` events are
  excluded from the AppMap.
* **`appmap/rspec`** exports `feature` and `feature_group` attributes to the AppMap `metadata`
  section.

# v0.8.0

* **`appmap upload`** accepts multiple arguments, to upload multiple files in one command.

# v0.7.0

* **`appmap/railtie`** is provided to integrate AppMap recording into Rails apps.
  * Use `gem :appmap, require: %w[appmap appmap/railtie]` to activate.
  * Set Rails configuration setting `config.appmap.enabled = true` to enable recording of the app via the Railtie, and
    to enable recording of RSpec tests via `appmap/rspec`.
  * In a non-Rails environment, set `APPMAP=true` to to enable recording of RSpec tests.
* **SQL queries** are reported as AppMap event `sql_query` data.
* **`self` attribute** is removed from `call` events.

# v0.6.0

* **Web server requests and responses** through WEBrick are reported as AppMap event `http_server_request` data.
* **Rails `params` hash** is reported as an AppMap event `message` data.
* **Rails `request`** is reported as an AppMap event `http_server_request` data.

# v0.5.1

# v0.5.0

* **'inspect', 'record' and 'upload' commands** are converted into a unified 'appmap' command with subcommands.
* **Config file name** is changed from .appmap.yml to appmap.yml.
* **`appmap.yml`** configuration format is updated.

# v0.4.0

Initial release.
